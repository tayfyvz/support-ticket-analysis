"Unable to Login","I cannot log in to my account. When I enter my credentials, I get an error message saying 'Invalid username or password'. I've tried resetting my password but the email never arrives. This is urgent as I need to access my account for work."
"Billing Discrepancy","I was charged $99.99 for my subscription this month, but my plan should only cost $49.99. I've been on the basic plan for 6 months and this is the first time I've seen this charge. Please investigate and issue a refund."
"Application Crash on Startup","The application crashes immediately when I try to open it. I'm using Windows 11 and the latest version. The error message says 'Application has stopped working'. This started happening after the last update."
"Request for Dark Mode Feature","I would love to see a dark mode option added to the application. I use the app frequently at night and the bright white background is hard on my eyes. Many users have requested this feature."
"Password Reset Email Not Working","I'm trying to reset my password but I'm not receiving the reset email. I've checked my spam folder and tried multiple times. My email address is correct in my account settings."
"Slow Performance on Dashboard","The dashboard takes over 15 seconds to load, and sometimes it times out completely. This happens consistently, especially when viewing reports. It used to load in 2-3 seconds."
"Export Data to Excel","It would be very helpful if users could export their data to Excel format. Currently, we can only export to CSV which doesn't preserve formatting. This would save a lot of time for reporting."
"Email Notifications Not Sending","I'm not receiving email notifications when tickets are assigned to me or when there are updates. I've checked my notification settings and they're all enabled. This is affecting my ability to respond quickly to customers."
"Account Locked After Failed Login Attempts","My account got locked after I entered the wrong password a few times. I've been trying to contact support but haven't received a response. I need access to my account urgently for an important project deadline."
"Integration with Slack Requested","We would like to integrate the ticketing system with Slack so that our team gets real-time notifications in our team channel. This would improve our response times significantly."
"Data Export Corrupted","When I export my monthly report, the CSV file is corrupted and cannot be opened in Excel. The file size looks correct but Excel shows an error. This has happened with the last 3 exports."
"UI Accessibility Issues","The color contrast on buttons is too low and doesn't meet WCAG accessibility standards. Users with visual impairments are having difficulty navigating the interface. We need to improve the color scheme."
"API Rate Limiting Too Strict","Our application is hitting API rate limits frequently, even though we're only making 100 requests per hour. The limit seems too low for our use case. Can we increase the limit or get a higher tier?"
"Missing Transaction History","I can see my recent transactions but cannot view transactions older than 3 months. I need to access my full transaction history for tax purposes. The data should be available in my account."
"Mobile App Crashes on iOS","The mobile app crashes when I try to upload photos on iOS 17. It works fine on Android. The crash happens immediately after selecting a photo from the gallery. This is affecting many iOS users."
