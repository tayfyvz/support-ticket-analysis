"Login Timeout","Users in EU region are reporting that the login screen spins for 60 seconds before failing with a timeout. Started after the latest CDN change."
"Export Button Icon","Export button uses download icon instead of export icon. Minor visual inconsistency, functionality correct."
"Database Connection Pool Exhausted","Production database connection pool exhausted during peak hours. API requests failing with 503 errors. Affecting ~30% of users between 2-4pm EST."
"Dark Mode Logo Contrast","Company logo in dark mode has low contrast against dark background. Still visible but doesn't meet brand guidelines. Purely aesthetic."
"Notifications Disabled","All webhook notifications to Zapier stopped around 3am UTC. No payloads recorded since then."
"Tooltip Text Wording","The tooltip on the export button says 'Download data' but should say 'Export data' for consistency. Very minor text change."
"User Data Deletion Bug","Deleting a user account sometimes fails to delete associated records in audit_log table. Manual cleanup required. Affected 3 out of 100 deletions this week."
"Mobile Menu Animation","The mobile menu slide-in animation could be smoother. Current animation works but feels a bit abrupt. Nice-to-have improvement."
"Payment Gateway Outage","Stripe payment gateway unavailable for 15 minutes. All checkout attempts failed during outage. Revenue loss estimated $5K. Service restored automatically."
"Profile Picture Border","User profile pictures in the sidebar don't have the rounded border shown in the mockups. Square corners work, just cosmetic preference."
"Account Access Locked","VIP client locked out after traveling; IP change triggered fraud rules. Need manual unlock plus allowlisting."
"Search Autocomplete Sorting","Search autocomplete results are alphabetically sorted, but users suggested sorting by relevance/frequency. Current sorting works fine, this is an enhancement."
"Forgot Password Link Expired","Password reset links expire after 1 hour but email delivery takes 2-3 hours during peak times. Users can't reset passwords, but can still log in with existing password."
"Button Hover Color","The 'Save' button hover state color is slightly different from the design spec. It's light blue instead of dark blue, but functionality works fine."
"Corrupted Data Export","Monthly KPI export downloaded from /reports returns an unreadable XLSX (Excel says file format mismatch)."
"Keyboard Shortcut Cheat Sheet","Feature request: Add a help dialog showing all available keyboard shortcuts. Not critical since shortcuts are documented in settings, but would be convenient."
"API Response Time Degradation","API response times increased from 200ms to 800ms average over last week. Still functional but noticeably slower. Affecting all endpoints."
"Profile Bio Character Limit","The profile bio field allows 500 characters but some users want 1000. Current limit works for most use cases, just a feature request."
"Unexpected Charge","Customer on the starter plan was billed twice for the same invoice (INV-99812). Needs refund and confirmation the duplicate charge won't reoccur."
"Notification Badge Style","The notification badge uses a solid red circle. Request to add option for outline style or different shapes. Pure cosmetic enhancement."
"Mobile App Crash on iOS 17","App crashes on launch for iOS 17.0-17.1 users. Affects ~5% of iOS users. iOS 16 and 17.2+ work fine. Temporary workaround: update iOS or use web version."
"Email Notification Preference","Feature request: Allow users to customize email notification frequency (instant, daily digest, weekly summary). Currently all notifications are instant."
"SAML Metadata Expired","Enterprise client's SAML metadata expired yesterday, causing SSO failures. Need to refresh and notify customer."
"Export Format Options","CSV export only, but users want JSON and Excel options. CSV works fine, this is a feature enhancement request."
"Session Timeout Too Short","User sessions expire after 15 minutes of inactivity. Users frequently have to re-login while filling forms. Works but creates friction, should be 30 minutes."
"Billing Address Validation","Checkout rejects valid Canadian postal codes (format A1A 1A1). Validation regex appears US-only."
"Search Results Highlighting","Search results don't highlight matching terms in the results list. Results are correct but harder to scan. Cosmetic improvement."
"Upload Crash","Desktop app (v2.3.1) crashes whenever a PDF larger than 25MB is uploaded. Stack trace references ImageMagick."
"Theme Color Option","Request to add more theme color options beyond the current 3. Users want purple and green theme variants for personalization."
"Two-Factor SMS Delay","SMS codes arrive after 5+ minutes for carriers in Canada; Twilio logs show delivery status `delayed`."
